//thread class start() registers the thread with 
//thread shceduler
//thread schedular will create new stack frame for the
//thread and then it calls the run method
//thats is why , we should not call run() directly


//t2.start()
//thread should be started only once
//calling start() twice will  throw a error illigegal exceptioná¹‡
